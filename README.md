### What is this repository for? ###

This repository hosts my solutions to problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)

### Disclaimer ###

This code was produced to solve the problem set, and do nothing more. Once it worked, I stopped typing. That means that it might be uglier than I would like. It does, however, pass all the test cases on the site.
